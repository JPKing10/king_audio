unusual place names, chemical compounds and other technical terms.

## Excellent client feedback

Clients praise Sarah for her quick turnaround, transparent pricing and first-rate accuracy. Here's

> It was wonderful to return back from my holidays to find all 4 focus groups transcribed. I have
> checked all of the files and they look great to me. Many thanks for the prompt and thorough job.  

> King Audio Transcription and Typing Services has been a pleasure to work with. Through our initial
> meeting, KATTS proved to be very pleasant and helpful. All email correspondences were very prompt
> and provided all the information I needed. Arranging the transfer of files was quick and easy. The
> transcriptions were accurate and turned around rapidly. The pricing of the services was very
> reasonable and clearly explained.
>
> I fully intend to use KATTS in the future and will recommend them to anyone needing these services.  

> Sarah provides a valuable service to my organisation in producing accurate transcription services.
> The quick turnaround time she provides helps me to programme our work schedule more easily. She is
> a great contact and I have recommended her services to colleagues and both internal and external  

> Chapman Lily Planning have procured the services of King Audio to provide a transcript of a Council’s planning committee meeting in support of a planning appeal which will include a claim for cists against the Council. Planning committee meeting minutes are notoriously limited in content, and having a word-for-word transcript could prove invaluable in demonstrating to the Government Planning Inspector how the Council’s planning committee failed to consider alternatives to refusing planning permission.

> King Audio provided a fast and efficient transcription service at an amazingly affordable cost. We will definitely be using King Audio again!
